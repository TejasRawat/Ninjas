1. Search an element in a sorted and rotated array. 
	The idea is to find the pivot point, divide the array in two sub-arrays and call binary search.
	The main idea for finding pivot is â€“ for a sorted (in increasing order) and pivoted array, pivot element is the only only element for which next element to it is smaller 
	than it.Using above criteria and binary search methodology we can get pivot element in O(logn) time
